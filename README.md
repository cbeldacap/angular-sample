# Angular Sample Project

How do I make it work?

Go to the project's root directory (`angular/` folder).

### 1. Install dependencies
You can either use **npm** or **yarn**

```
.../angular$ npm install
```
```
.../angular$ yarn
```

### 2. Serve it to your web browser (Chrome recommended)

```
.../angular$ ng serve
```
```
.../angular$ yarn start
```
